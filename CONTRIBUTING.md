Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions are always welcome. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks in advance!

When filing a bug, please try to be as detailed as possible. In addition to the bug report form information, details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The date/commit/version(s) of the code you're running
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

Guidelines for bug reports:

- Check to see if your issue is addressed in the [FAQ Wiki](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-console/blob/master/FAQ.md)!
- Check to see if a [duplicate or closed issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-console/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) already exists
- Provide a short and descriptive issue title
- Remove any sensitive data from your examples or snippets
- Format any code snippets using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) syntax

Finally, thank you for taking the time to read this, and taking the time to write a good bug report.
